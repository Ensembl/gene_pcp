# Jupyter notebooks

The notebooks are saved as Python scripts using [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext). Install Jupytext in JupyterLab to open the scripts and generate notebooks or [create notebooks from the command line](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-create-a-notebook-from-a-text-file).
